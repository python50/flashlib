=Flashlib=
-----
Intended for Upper and Mid-Range PIC 8 bit microcontrollers by Microchip (ie. PIC18F, PIC16F, and PIC12F)

A simple interface to the flash memory controller used in the enhanced mid-range PIC microcontrollers. While this library was made for the PIC16F1518, it can easily be configured to work with many other microcontrollers.

This library provides functions to read, write, and erase data from flash memory. If you find any errors, or find youself making improvements when including this in your own project I encourage you to send your patches and feedback to me.

This library was created by Jason White as part of a much larger project. Due to the lack of example code found on the internet, he decided to release this code as a small library for use and study by all.
