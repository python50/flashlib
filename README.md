#===Flashlib===
-----
Intended for Upper and Mid-Range PIC 8 bit microcontrollers by Microchip

Flahlib is a simple interface to the flash memory controller used in the enhanced mid-range PIC microcontrollers. This library was created and tested for the PIC16F1518, but should work without a hitch on just about every modern PIC microcontroller.

This library provides functions to read, write, and erase data from flash memory. If you find any errors, or find yourself making improvements -feel free to send patches/feedback to creator of this library: Jason White.

Note: this is intended for Microchips new XC8 compiler, its free and cross platform -you can find it on Microchip's website (microchip.com).

##===Credits===

This library was created by Jason White as part of a much larger project. Due to the lack of example code found on the internet, he decided to release this code as a small library for use and study by all.
